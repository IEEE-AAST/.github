  ## Vision:
  Our vision is to be the leading student activity in Egypt. We aim to provide technical perspective to all AAST students by working with engineering companies and 
  course providers. We plan to collaborate with other IEEE student branches and Egypt section to become a fierce competitor in local, national, and international 
  engineering competitions and IEEE competitions as well.
  
## Values:
- Innovation:
     We achieve innovation by hosting trend-setting events with professional experts in all engineering departments. Our members are allowed to think individually 
     in projects and ideas and discuss these ideas with faculty staff to reach the best outcome possible.

- Personal Development:
     We achieve personal development by engaging our members in various projects while working in a team. This would develop technical skills and leadership 
     skills and would allow for engagement with each other; developing team spirit.

- Fun:
     We work in a friendly environment, on projects related to our members’ specialisations, interests and passion. This creates a fun atmosphere that would 
     certainly give our members a sense of achievement and belonging.

- Respect:
     We strive to be better listeners and team players by respecting each other’s opinions, being open for feedback, being honest with each other and responsible
     for our work.


## Mission:
 Our mission is to develop technical and professional skills that would set our members up properly for the labour market; by constantly and consistently 
 participating in various engineering competitions and projects.
